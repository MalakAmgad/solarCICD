Perfect üôå Adding a **README.md** will make your project much clearer for anyone who looks at it (including future you).
Since your workflow is a **CI/CD pipeline with testing, Docker, Terraform, and EKS deployment**, here‚Äôs a starter README you can adapt:

# üåå Solar System Project

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a **Node.js microservice** deployed to **AWS EKS** using **GitHub Actions, Docker, and Terraform**.

## üöÄ Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow (`solar system workflow`) runs automatically on:

* Pushes to `main` or `feature-brancheA`
* Manual triggers via **workflow\_dispatch**

### Jobs

1. **Unit Testing**

   * Runs tests on Node.js versions `18, 19, 20` across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
   * Archives test results as artifacts.

2. **Code Coverage**

   * Runs code coverage reports.
   * Archives coverage reports for inspection.

3. **Docker**

   * Builds and pushes Docker images to **Docker Hub** and **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.
   * Runs container locally inside workflow for smoke testing.

4. **Terraform Deployment**

   * Provisions infrastructure in **AWS us-west-2**.
   * Creates VPC, EKS cluster, subnets, and other required resources.

5. **Kubernetes Deployment**

   * Deploys the application to the **EKS cluster**.
   * Creates a **LoadBalancer Service** to expose the app.
   * Verifies pods and services.
   * Retrieves the **LoadBalancer URL** (application endpoint).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Running Locally

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd solar-system
npm install
npm test
```

Run locally with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t solar-system .
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri> \
  -e MONGO_USERNAME=<your-username> \
  -e MONGO_PASSWORD=<your-password> \
  solar-system
```

Visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## üåê Deployment

After GitHub Actions completes:

1. The app is deployed to **AWS EKS**.
2. A **LoadBalancer URL** is created.
3. To get the endpoint, run:

```bash
kubectl get svc microservice-service -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
```

You can then access the app at:

```
http://<loadbalancer-dns>:80
```

## üîë Secrets Required

* `MONGO_USERNAME`
* `MONGO_PASSWORD`
* `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`
* `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

---

## ‚úÖ Example Workflow Run

1. Push to `main`.
2. GitHub Actions runs all jobs.
3. Docker images published to:

   * `docker.io/<username>/solar-system:latest`
   * `ghcr.io/<username>/solar-system:latest`
4. Terraform provisions AWS infra.
5. Kubernetes deploys app + service.
6. Get **public LoadBalancer URL** and open the project in your browser.
